I am a software engineer at [Google][1], working on [Fuchsia][2].

I like writing [Haskell][3] and [Rust][4], and I'm generally into functional
programming and things with strong, static type systems.

I'm also a real person too, who likes hiking, camping, woodworking, and
drinking rum, among other things.
